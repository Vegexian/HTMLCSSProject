<h1>Describing Further Improvements I Can Make To My Project</h1>

<p>
    If I had more time on the customisation of the webpage I would improve the appearance even further by adding pictures, more variety in the colour or even experiment more with the fonts and font colours.<br>
    I would also go through my answers with a fine-toothed comb to help improve my answers, removing any repetition within the same answer that isnâ€™t needed, potentially shortening the lengthy answers and also potentially increasing clarity for the overall answers.<br>
    If I had more time, I would also implement the JavaScript game that we created in our other project so that anyone could play it that visit the website. I would need to edit it to describe better how the game is played within the HTML page itself.<br>
    The changes I have made to the plan of my website have resulted in cutting certain styling out of my website. Originally I was planning on having a drop down menu to hold the navigation around the website and make it look neater. Due to a couple failed attempts and the amount of time spent trying to get it to work and the remaining time for the project, I decided to cut it out and just have a normal navigation bar at the top of the page.<br>
    One of the things I spent a long time checking was the navigation bar. I wanted to definitely make sure that all the buttons worked and directed to the correct page regardless of which page the user is on.
