<h1>Describing Accessibility Issues That Need Taking Into Account When Creating A Website</h1>

<p>
    When it comes to accessibility for websites, businesses and companies have to cater to as many 
    as they can, if not all of them. For people who are colour-blind, the websites would need to 
    have the options to change the colour filter to make it easier to view the webpage. <br> 
    An example that a colour-blind person could benefit from this is being able to navigate the 
    webpages a lot easier, increasing the likeliness of their custom. 
</p>

<p>
    Another accessibility option that would be needed would be a setting that can increase the 
    magnification of the page for those who have diminished sight. If the user was short sighted or 
    long sighted, a magnification feature could help both cases by allowing the user to zoom in or 
    zoom out of the webpage to suit their vision. <br>
    Another function would be a text-to-audio. This could also prove useful for those with difficulty 
    seeing the webpage as it allows the user to hear what is written on the webpage instead of 
    struggling to read it.  
</p>

<p>
    If a website has any audio/video content, a subtitle feature should be implemented for any 
    customers that are hard of hearing or have completely lost their hearing. This will help them 
    understand the website and help navigate around the website to find what they need. <br>
    The website would have to be written in a clear and concise manner to minimise all possibility 
    of confusion for the user. This would mean to avoid using complex vocabulary, especially words 
    that would require a dictionary to look up the meaning for.
</p>

<p>
    Any pictures that are on the website would need to be coupled with a couple basic descriptive 
    words to increase the ease of understanding the content on the webpage.
