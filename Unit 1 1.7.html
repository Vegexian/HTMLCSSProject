    <h1 id = "shift">Describing Legal Guidelines And Constraints That Impact Digital Projects</h1>

<p>
    The main guidelines and constraints of digital projects are accumulated in to the GDPR and they were drafted and passed by the European Union (EU). <br>
    GDPR stands for "General Data Protection Regulation" and is the new data privacy and security laws for companies around the world to abide by if they want 
    to have their businesses accessible in Europe. The GDPR contains hundreds of pages worth of new regulations and security checks to provide more security to 
    EU citizens because it is stricter on businesses that aim to target and collect information on citizens of the EU.
    The GDPR was put into effect on 25th May 2018 and is the toughest set of regulations for businesses to conform to in the world. 
</p>

<p>
    The UK adopted GDPR into law via the Data Protection Act 2018 which replaced the 1998 version of the Data Protection Act. Previously, organisations and businesses 
    that violated these laws could be charged with a maximum fine of £500,000 by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). With the updated Data Protection Act, 
    organisations and businesses that violate these laws could be subject to fines of up to £20 million or up to 4% of the company’s annual turnover, which can be 
    higher.

<p>
    "Below is a list of the most important elements that the GDPR affects":
</p>

<ul id = "exclude">
    <li>"Personal data - Personal data is any information that relates to an individual who can be directly or indirectly identified. Names and email addresses are 
        obviously personal data. Location information, ethnicity, gender, biometric data, religious beliefs, web cookies, and political opinions can also be personal 
        data. Pseudonymous data can also fall under the definition if it’s relatively easy to ID someone from it."</li>
    
    <li>"Data processing - Any action performed on data, whether automated or manual. The examples cited in the text include collecting, recording, organizing, 
        structuring, storing, using, erasing… so basically anything."</li>

    <li>"Data subject - The person whose data is processed. These are your customers or site visitors."</li>

    <li>"Data controller - The person who decides why and how personal data will be processed. If you’re an owner or employee in your organization who handles data, 
        this is you."</li>

    <li>"Data processor - A third party that processes personal data on behalf of a data controller. The GDPR has special rules for these individuals and organizations. 
        They could include cloud servers like OneDrive or email service providers like Hotmail"</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The regulations that have to be abided by at bare minimum before a business or organization can collect data from people can be summarised as such:
</p>

<ol id = uniform>
    <li>"Lawfulness, fairness and transparency - Processing must be lawful, fair, and transparent to the data subject."</li>
    <li>"Purpose limitation - You must process data for the legitimate purposes specified explicitly to the data subject when you collected it."</li>
    <li>"Data minimization - You should collect and process only as much data as absolutely necessary for the purposes specified."</li>
    <li>"Accuracy - You must keep personal data accurate and up to date."</li>
    <li>"Storage limitation - You may only store personally identifying data for as long as necessary for the specified purpose."</li>
    <li>"Integrity and confidentiality - Processing must be done in such a way as to ensure appropriate security, integrity, and confidentiality (e.g. by using encryption)."</li>
    <li>"Accountability - The data controller is responsible for being able to demonstrate GDPR compliance with all of these principles."</li>
</ol>
