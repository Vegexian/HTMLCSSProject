<h1>Reviewing The Ongoing Use Of I.T Tools And Changes That Were Needed</h1>



<p>
    I am happy with the tools we used to create our websites. The tools we used are Visual Studio Code, Trello, Zoom and Google Hangouts.
</p>
<p>
    These were selected to enable learning on the course and be able to demonstrate our understanding of what we learnt. Visual Studio Code was selected to allow us to write code and write a long with the tutors which can help us understand how to perform what we’re being taught.<br>
    VSCode was vital to our learning on this course. VSCode made it possible to write files of different data types, such as HTML CSS and JavaScript, within the same program and allowed us to create our JavaScript Text-Based game and our website as both require a combination of multiple files coming together. <br>
    Trello was selected as a tool to allow us to plan our projects with incredible ease and making the Trello board public allows the tutors to jump in a check on the progress on everyone’s projects without having to disrupt someone from working whilst they explain where they’re up to.<br>
    Zoom and Google Hangouts were selected for the purpose of video calling. Zoom was utilised to perform a conference call with the course to deliver teaching virtually to all candidates. Google Hangouts was utilised to perform 1to1 meetings with tutors and students if required without having to end the Zoom call for the entire class.
