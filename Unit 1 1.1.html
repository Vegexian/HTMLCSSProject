    <h1>Describing The Purpose Of I.T In Modern Businesses</h1>

<p>
    There are many purposes for the modern business to be using I.T.<br>
    I.T can be used to help create an infrastructure for a business, a domain that their employees would monitor and work from, such as customer service and tech support, and for the customers to visit, dependant on the company, for information, purchasing goods, reporting a problem or filing a complaint. It provides an easy and convenient means to keep communication between everyone involved simple, quick and accessible.
    I.T systems also help to extend the reach of any business that incorporates a well structured I.T system as that can open up custom to national or even 
    international customers. This would bring about the chance of expansion too. Such as allowing the posibillity of hiring from all around the country or international employees as well as customers, introducing diversity a long the way. <br> 
    Without the use of an I.T system, the company would have a very limited number of customers, most of which would be within the same city, 
    if not region of county like "Greater Manchester", where as with a business website, they could have customers from London, Cardiff, Belfast et because their 
    website would be accessible online.
