<h1 id = "heads">Describing The Correct File-Types For Websites</h1>

<p>
    There are several file-types that are accepted for websites that the website interpret in particular ways to enhance the website itself. These are:<br>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
".AVI – Audio/Video Interleaved:<br>
    This is a standard video format supported on the windows platform. They do not stream, however, so you have to download the entire file before you can watch any of it."<br>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
".CSS – Cascading StyleSheet:<br>
    Css files are a file-type used to store the styling of HTML pages that the HTML page can call to when displaying the website. This is where the font, font colour, background colours, page layout and many other customisations can be applied."<br>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
".DOC – Microsoft Word DOCument:<br>
    Microsoft Word is the most popular word processing software in the world and there aren’t many applications that can open this file-type whilst keeping the format 100% true to the original."<br>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
".EXE – EXEcutable File:<br>
    This is a file-type that is most seen when downloading an application or program. These can be downloaded from websites that will have the file stored in a server that the website connects to when you click download."<br>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
".GIF – Graphics Interchange Format:<br>
    The most common image format on the internet. This can be used to loop a small video clip or series of images for entertainment purposes."<br>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
".HTML/.HTM – HyperText Markup Language File:<br>
    The majority of websites that are created use HTML 5/HTM for the basic webpage layout which are then coupled with CSS pages to help customise them."<br>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
".JPG/.JPEG – Joint Photographic Experts Group File:<br>
    Another very common image file-type that is mostly used for photos."<br>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
".MIDI/.MID – Musical Instrument Digital Interface:<br>
    MIDIs are digitally sequenced music files made primarily on MIDI keyboards and using software within a recording program to alter the sound of the keyboard to imitate other instruments."<br>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
".MP3 – MPEG Layer 3 Sound File:<br>
    MP3 is a sound file-type which is highly compressed, that can be downloaded from websites. They have incredibly high quality despite the low file size after compression."<br>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
".MPEG/ .MPG - Motion Picture Experts Group file:<br>
    One of the standards for streaming movies."<br>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
".MOV/ .QT - QuickTime MOVie:<br>
    The QuickTime format was designed by Apple and originated on the Mac, but has made the transition to the PC and is hugely popular."<br>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
".PDF - Portable Document Format:<br>
    Adobe Acrobat files were invented so that documents could be transferred between computers and platforms and still look the exact same. One of the user-friendliest file-types around."<br>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
".PNG - Portable Network Graphics:<br>
    PNGs are a file format designed to be used in place of GIFs. They are usually slightly smaller, and sport advanced features like alpha-channel transparency and 24-bit colour support."<br>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
".RAM - Real Audio Movie:<br>
    Real Networks created formats for streaming audio and video, and gave away free players for the formats, before allowing themselves to become so smothered in advertising that 	everyone with sense decided to stop using their programs."<br>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
".RAR - RAR Archive:<br>
    This is a compressed file format similar to the popular .zip format. It sports advanced functions like special multimedia compression and has many benefits over zip files."<br>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
".TIFF - Tagged Image File Format:<br>
    For really high quality images, TIFFs are used, but cannot be viewed through a browser."<br>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
".TXT - TeXT File:<br>
    The most basic of files, it’s just some text."<br>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
".WAV - WAVe sound File:<br>
    A basic, either un- or not very- compressed sound file, usually used for short sound samples."<br>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
".ZIP - ZIPped File:<br>
