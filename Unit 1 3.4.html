<h1>Describing How I Would Go About Testing Digital Solutions</h1>

<p>
    I would test it myself by opening up the project in the correct medium, such as a webpage, to see if they work as intended. This would allow me to see for myself any new changes made to the projects are working as intended and if they’re not, I can resort back to the code to either tweak it if it’s almost there, or completely undo that addition to revert it back to how it was so I know not to go in that direction.<br>
    I could also post my projects onto coding platforms like GitHub, make the repository public and ask for people’s feedback. This would provide an outside look to your projects from people who understand coding and can offer tips and tricks to improve your projects such as neatening up your code or even improving the functionality of your project by suggesting features I may not have thought of.<br>
    Another way to test a project, especially a website or application, would be to invite your friends and/family an early insight and ask them for feedback. This will give you an outside look of your project but from people who don’t know how to code which would help you to update your project to become more user friendly. Feedback like if the view is a bit jarring or if they find it difficult to use would provide valuable feedback for you to improve your project so it becomes accessible for everyone.
