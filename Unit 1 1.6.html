    <h1>Describing And Providing Analysis On How Our Chosen Technologies Have Helped Us Achieve Our Outcomes</h1>

<p>
    Our chosen technologies: Zoom, Google Hangouts, Slack, Trello, Visual Studio Code(VSCode).
    We used Zoom to help us communicate with our tutors which is how we were taught the course. Zoom allowed us to have all the students in a conference call with the 
    tutors who delivered their lessons with ease. It was a very useful tool to simulate a classroom when we have to work from home.
</p>

<p>
    Google Hangouts was used in a similar manner but was reserved for communicating between our team members which came in useful during the team project as we could 
    communicate between ourselves without having to worry about another team borrowing our ideas for their own project. This allowed us to stay in the class conference 
    video call and have our team chat at the same time. We also used the share screen function in Google Hangouts to help demonstrate where we were up to in our work, 
    this was mostly used when we had taken on different tasks and then came together afterwards to combine all our work into one file.
</p>

<p>
    Slack was used as an instant messaging service where we could also share files and code with each other. Slack allowed us to create private channels for our team
    project to also allow us as a team to talk freely about our project without having to be concerned with another team taking our ideas. It also allowed for a 
    personal status updater which allowed us to see who was online, busy, away on lunch or offline, this came in handy when we needed to contact a tutor and could see 
    if they were online in the first place.
</p>

<p>
    Trello was used to help plan and organise our projects with the Kanban approach. This is organising tasks in a priority order categorized as “To do”, “Currently 
    doing” and “Completed” which were used as clear indicators of where we were up to in the development of the project so nobody was confused on what needed doing. 
    It also helped divide workload up as we were able to add our Trello signature to independent cards and move the cards freely between each column. For example, I 
    could move one of the cards to “currently doing” and add my initials to it and that would show the rest of the team that I have started working on that card. 
    Seeing this, another team member could do the same with a different card and within a few steps we would easily be able to tell everyone in the team who is working 
    on what without the need of speaking to them directly.
</p>

<p>
    VSCode was used to help us write our code out in the correct format for the project to work. Our JavaScript game worked within a HTML page so as long as we saved 
    the files to the corresponding file types, the VSCode worked efficiently in recognising the code format and identifying errors that would prevent the code from 
    working and thus the game wouldn’t work. The main issue with this was that it wasn’t always clear, at least to new users, what the actual issue was and took longer 
    than it should to identify the actual issue or someone with a more trained eye to notice what was unusual about the code.

<p>
    GitHub is an online website/forum that allows for the sharing of coding projects between fellow coders who can offer help and advice if needed that can help your projects improve. You can also offer your help to others if you want to help the coding community of over 40 million users (as of August 2019). This will be the main domain where any coding projects would be uploaded to and how you can publish them through GitHub and any potential employers can visit your profile and see what you can do and if you're serious about coding.
