    VSCode was a very handy tool used to help us write code and also check if the code works. VSCode would indicate if a section of code wasn’t going to work with ‘Syntax Error’, ‘Unexpected Token’ error codes can appear a long with many others and these also point out which line the program expects the issue to be on.<br>
    A downside with this feature is sometimes the line pointed out to have the error isn’t always the line that is directly causing the error. But it does accurately select the correct area of the code.

    I could have planned my time better by spending more time on the content of my answers rather than applying certain CSS features but with doing so, I have managed to check whether that CSS feature would work the way I intended or not. <br>
    I would also add a JavaScript page to increase the functionality of my website and add a variety of features to increase smoothness of the website.

    With working solo on this project, I had to manage a lot more when compared to working in a team. For this I can compare working on my website and working on the game as part of a team. Working on my own for the website, I had to manage the Trello board for the whole website, plan the design and how the content was going to be laid out within the HTML page. I also had to split my time between, updating the Trello board regularly, adding the content to my HTML pages so all my answers are on there and also thinking of styles for the website to be in and trying them out.<br>
    Whereas in a team, we can divide these between us and also switch up who does which part so 1 person isn’t stuck doing 1 job throughout the whole project so we all could have experienced each step for ourselves. We could also be able to step in for each other if needed to help take over when a team member hits a wall, whether it is patience with getting a feature to work, researching content to put within the webpages or making sure Trello is up-to-date. We can also discuss multiple ideas for the end project between us to get an idea of the final product. Being in live conversation with teammates allows us to call up our team members for immediate feedback from each other so changes to our projects would be more efficiently made.

    There are some cons to working in a team. One of these is having to have Stand-Ups where we have a meeting with our team members and refresh everyone about what has been done within the project   and the current plan going forward and get any feedback that members may have thought about before the Stand-Up. Whereas working on your own, you wouldn’t need to perform a Stand-Up and can spend that time getting stuck in with the project.<br>
    Working in a team though could relive elements of stress as you can ask someone to take over your work for a period of time whilst you rest your mind from the task at hand and direct it at another task that makes you think in a different way.
