<h1>Developing Solutions To Improve Own Productivity Using I.T In Digital Solutions</h1>

<p>
    What I could do next time, if I were to be given a project like this, would be to try it as part of a team. This would be different as we could compile a variety of ideas for the project and also split the roles up between the team. This would make it easier if the members of the team would only need to focus more on one thing instead of the whole project. Of course they can help in all areas they want to/need to, but their assigned role would take priority. Have it set up in a way like that could help reduce stress levels which would increase productivity and efficiency so the project could benefit greatly from these benefactors.<br>
    I would also focus more on the writing side for the content within the webpages. I would aim to have the very basic HTML pages with no CSS and aim to get all the questions answered before changing anything on the website. This should allow me more time to focus on the construction of the website itself and the styling of it as I wouldn’t be going back and forth between incomplete sections of project. I wouldn’t want to have my website nearly complete to find out I have 1 or 2 more questions still to answer.
</p>
<p>
    I would also ask for more pointers for my answers so I am more confident writing them for the questions being asked as they are worded in such a way that there are multiple correct answers, depending on how they are interpreted. This would give ease of mind so I know that I am on the correct path for an answer and hopefully negate lengthy answers and any doubt in my answers.<br>
    I would also send compressed project files to course members and tutors for feedback so I can take it on board and make changes for the benefit of my project, the more feedback the better. This can also be obtained by posting the project to coding forums and pages like GitHub where other coders can offer their advice and expertise.<br>
    If I had the time, I would also implement the use of pictures onto my projects better now that I have the knowledge and somewhat of an idea on how to apply it to my projects.
