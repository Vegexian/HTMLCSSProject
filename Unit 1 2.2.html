<h1>Describing Whether The I.T Tools Were Appropriate</h1>

<p>
    Visual Studio Code is very helpful when writing code, whether itâ€™s HTML, CSS, JavaScript or any other language. The program helps with writing code in the correct format and layout, highlights any areas of code that are out of format and has handy features that help writing.<br>
    An example is, there is a split screen mode for VSCode that makes coding easy. This is particularly helpful for when editing a CSS file for the HTML pages so you can edit both at the same time. This helps link the correct parts together with the use of the class and id system.<br>
    Trello has also been very useful with planning out a project. The Kanban system that Trello encourages the use of even with the default load up is very useful for all projects. We used Trello to help plan our JavaScript game and help us keep track of what we need to do to for our game and our website.<br>
    The use of Zoom and Google Hangouts provided very useful for communicating with the rest of the team and the tutors. Zoom was selected to hold the classes in as it allows conference calls between all course takers and tutors for that course. The screen share function is very useful when requesting help because the tutors are able to see the screen and help similarly to how they would inside the classroom.
