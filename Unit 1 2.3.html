<h1>Assessing The Strengths And Weaknesses Of My Final Project</h1>

<p>
    I am happy with the result of my website because my previous attempt at creating a website when I was trying to teach myself was not up to this standard which shows how far I’ve come since starting the course at Code Nation.<br>
    I assessed my website by running it in Google Chrome and refreshing it regularly to update it when I had edited the HTML or CSS pages. If there was a change that didn’t result in what I intended, then I could go straight back to VSCode and undo the most recent change and try a new approach.<br>
    I believe the strengths of my final project are the ease of navigation, how viewing the website is easy on the eyes and how informative the pages are. I aimed for a professional styled website that wasn’t too busy and the use of the website would reflect the HTML code well.<br>
    There is a navigation bar at the top of the page that makes changing webpages a breeze. This navigation bar stays at the top of the pages even when scrolling down the pages where scrolling is needed. <br>
    I believe the weaknesses of my website are the length of my pages, some seemingly too short and others too long, and the basic appearance of it.
