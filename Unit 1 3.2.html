<h1>Describing Ways Of Increasing Productivity And Efficiency</h1>

<p>
    One way to improve productivity and efficiency would be to take regular breaks. Having regular breaks allows for you to rest your mind and de-stress from any task that may have been causing issues. Taking regular breaks would also allow you to get up and stretch after sitting at a computer for so long which also elevates mood.<br>
    Increasing your mood through your own means, or even through a company funding a team building exercising course, could improve morale and thus the quality of the project. <br>
    Another method would be to learn to step back from a challenge that may be stressing you out or proving to difficult for the time being and try a new challenge to take your mind off of that challenge, then when you come back after refreshing your mind, it may be that everything you were struggling with before just slot into place.<br>
    I believe resting from a particularly challenging task or cutting yourself some slack when it comes to your work is key to achieving higher productivity and the efficiency would come afterwards.
