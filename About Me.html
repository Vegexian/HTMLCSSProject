    <h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
    Hi, I'm Karl. I am 25 years old and I have a strong passion for technology and my aim is to get a job in the technology industry and succeed. I have a strong interest and passion for technology and computers. I spend pretty much all my time with computers, whether it's playing game, learning to code or even fixing something for a family member. I enjoy all of them. My hobbies include: gaming, music, electric guitar and recently learning in general. Because of Code Nation, I am definitely going to spend more of my spare time polishing my coding abilities and try and create a new project.
</p> 
  

<p>
    My previous work history is all scientific. I began as a Laboratory Assistant for a company called Concept Life Sciences for about 3 months then a vacancy came about for a Laboratory Technician.<br>
    My manager and the Senior Laboratory Technician had took me into a meeting where they revealed they had been impressed with my work ethic, initiative and helpfulness to my co-workers that they would like to offer me the position straight away before advertising it. I accepted the new position as I wanted to progress up the career ladder. I then spent around 1 year and 8 months as a Laboratory Technician, learning all the extraction methods that the Laboratory offered so that I could be as useful and as knowledgeable as I could be. <br> 
    It was around the end of this time period that I learnt of a vacancy for Laboratory Analyst within the same company. Fortunately, my reputation as a Laboratory 
    Technician was pretty good with the Laboratory Analysts, as my extractions had a very high success rate, so the Laboratory Manager of the Laboratory Analysts was 
    keen to get me onto his team. I had done my research for the position although, there was still a lot to learn, I had managed to pick up how to use ChemStation, NIST and all the other analyst duties quickly and I was able to pass what I had learnt to the newer employees within the first month.
</p>

<p>
    I decided to join Code Nation because, after the 4 years 3 months of working within a laboratory, the company unfortunately had a mass redundancy. A friend 
    of mine had suggested looking into a career in IT as he said it's the best job he has had in terms of the work-life balance and what he actually does for the job 
    too. I have a great interest in computers and gaming and I decided to begin my new career path into coding. He also shared a couple links to 
    help me begin my learning, such as freecodecamp.org, to help learn at least the basics. With doing this in my spare time, I managed to do what I could when I could. 
</p>

<p>
    Then during one of my Job Centre appointments, I had told my work coach that I was interested in coding and that I wanted to expand my possibilities of work. It was a couple weeks or so after this that I received a phone call from my work coach informing me that representatives of Code Nation had visited the job centre advertising their courses to which she had passed my information onto them. Once everything was sorted, I got my course start date for 14th April 2020 and counted down the days until I would begin this journey.
</p>

<p>
    My experience so far with Code Nation has been nothing short of excellent. The course tutors and representatives are friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful 
    whenever you don't understand something or have a piece of broken code and can't find why/where it's broken. My classmates are all friendly and helpful to everyone 
    as well, especially when Jay and Liam are in a meeting. The course content is clear and concise and is explained in great detail. Looking back, there is a lot of 
    content that has been condensed down into these 3 weeks and I am genuinely impressed with how well I soaked up the knowledge.
