    <h1>Describing How I Would Go About Selecting And Using I.T Systems And Software</h1>

<p>
    How I would select the technology and software for the job all depends on what I need specifically for that job itself. I wouldn't start a digital project without 
    a computer of some sorts. Anything electronic would be a major step towards beginning the digital project, such as a tablet, laptop or desktop. <br>
    If I were required to work whilst on the move, I would opt for a laptop as it will be more powerful than a tablet and offers the portability required with this 
    project, whereas a desktop would only be available at home due to it's bulkier nature. If I had office computers at work and didn't need to work on the go, I would 
    choose a desktop to have at home because for the most part, desktops are sturdier and can provide the extra power that may be needed, dependant on the project being 
    worked on. Having computers at the office would negate the need to have to work whilst travelling to and from the office but not if you were out on a business trip 
    where the laptop would be chosen. If I didnâ€™t have a laptop or it was at home, I would be able to make notes on my mobile device of any information that would be 
    regarded as useful for the project or the business in general.
</p>

<p>
    I would also select the software in the same manner, for example. If I was going to create a JavaScript file to work on my own HTML page, I would use a text editor 
    such as Visual Studio Code (VSCode) by Microsoft, although Notepad or Microsoft Office Word work almost as well. The benefit to VSCode is that, when you create a 
    JavaScript, HTML or any other file it'll recognise how the text inside should be laid out and highlight any errors, whereas the other text editors offered as 
    examples don't. A downside to VSCode is there is no default spelling and grammar checker so it could take a few glances to see if there are no spelling errors.
