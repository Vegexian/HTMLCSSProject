    <h1>Describing Methods, Skills And Resources Needed To Complete A Digital Project</h1>

<p>
    There are a variety of methods, skills and resources used to aid the completion of a digital project. The key ones would be, communication, teamwork and planning 
    thoroughly. There are websites that can help with all of these. For our JavaScript game, we utilised the Kanban method and displayed our thoughts and plan on 
    trello.com, we utilised applications like Zoom and Google Hangouts to hold live team discussions to share ideas and discuss how we would further develop and 
    enhance our game. We also used applications like diagrams.net, to help use create a storyboard for our game with the use of flow charts. <br>
    This helped us keep all members of our team in the loop of discussion when a new idea comes to mind, or a problem arises, so we were all involved in every step 
    of the development. Having everyone be involved and have their input helps create a healthy workplace relationship and improves the success rate of the digital 
    project and ensures the project is made to everyone's standards.
