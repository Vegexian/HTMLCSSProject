<h1>Reviewing Outcomes And Make Sure They Match Requirements And Are Fit For Purpose</h1>

<p>
    Looking back at my website, I can say it is now fit for purpose. It is easily accessible and anyone can navigate through the pages thanks to the navigation bar being at the top of the webpage constantly.<br>
    I took out features that were still in the experimental stage, such as implementing a drop down menu for navigation, as I hadn't managed to get that to work before the deadline. This can always be added at a later date which can be good for future prospects and keeping my activity up when we post our projects to GitHub.<br>
    I made sure to make my website easy on the eyes with the dark background, readable by making the colour of the font one that stands out from the background but doesn't pierce the eyes and I made sure that my final website ran the way it should and doesnâ€™t log in any errors within the code by the time of submission.
