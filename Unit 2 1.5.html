    <h1>Describing Copyright And Other Constraints That Affect Websites</h1>
    
<p>
    Copyright is a form of protection for your products or work that you create and prevents others from using and claiming as their own work to make a profit. 
    Copyright also prevents the use of ones work without their permission and without crediting the original creator somewhere that is obvious and clear to see. 
    This can be performed by supplying hyperlinks to the source of information or content where it was acquired from.
</p>

<p>
    Copyright is automatically acquired as soon as you create an original project. It is best practice to sign and date it on the day the project is finalized as to 
    avert legal issues down the line if another person has used your work and claimed it as their own. Although signing your work, applying the © and dating your work
    doesn’t improve of decrease the level of protection you have.
</p>

<p>
    Copyright has an expiry date so others can use your work eventually. For most types of work, this usually lasts most of a lifetime for the creator but there are 
    shorter copyright protection lifespans. <br>
    Below is a table to help demonstrate the relation between the type of work and the length of the copyright protection.

        For websites to be accepted and published to the internet, they need to conform to several legislations before they’re given the green light. 
        These are: The Data Protection Act 1998[Latest version was created in 2018], The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, Accessibility – The Disability 
        Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) [has been replaced with the Equality Act 2010], E-Commerce Regulations 2002, W3C Validation (World Wide Web Consortium) and The 
        Companies Act 2008.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Data Protection Act is a set of regulations and laws for companies that store and handle any or all their consumer, or potential consumer, data must abide
        by if they wish to sell their products or advertise their business within the UK. It is aimed towards small or medium sized businesses mostly, but could be 
        helpful for larger businesses if they wish to apply. <br>
        If the business wishes to do so, they would need to apply for registration for their company under The Data Protection Act which will allow the company to form 
        a foundation within the market. Registration is inexpensive but must be obtained through the governments website.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 state that if you have an online presence and you collect and store 
        information from prospective clients/other users, then you must disclose certain information on you website in the form of a ‘Privacy Policy’. 
        To sum this up; “users must be able to opt out of any disclosure, must be advised who will be using the information, who it may be disclosed to and they must 
        be advised of Cookie usage”.
    </p>

    <p>
        The PECR was created with the aim of providing privacy rights in relation to electronic communications. These regulations control the privacy of customers and 
        other users, specifically, electronic communication between them and businesses. <br>
        They have specific rules regarding:
    </p>

    <ul id = "exclude">
        <li>"Marketing calls, Emails, Texts and Faxes"</li>
        <li>"Cookies (and similar technologies)"</li>
        <li>"Keeping Communications Services Secure"</li>
        <li>"Customer Privacy as Regards Traffic and Location Data, Itemised Billing, Line Identification and Directory Listings."</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These regulations will limit the amount of times the business can contact their customers for advertisement purposes to prevent spamming the customer with unwanted
        calls, emails, texts or faxes. Companies conforming to these regulations also have to provide a secure connection with their customers which can be encrypting the 
        connection when an IP address connects to the company’s website.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Disability Discrimination Act of 1995 received an update in 2010 and was replaced by The Equality Act 2010.
        The DDA/ The Equality Act was created to ensure that businesses with an online presence make their websites accessible by everyone but possibly more so for 
        people with disabilities. They would need to allow features within their website that can be utilised to help disabled people have as smooth as possible 
        experience when visiting their website. There are several types of discrimination that can affect the relationship between customers and businesses. <br>
        Below are some categories and examples with some examples from the Equality Act:
    </p>
    <ul id = "exclude">
        <li>"Direct Discrimination – Refusing to employee someone because they are blind"</li>
        <li>"Disability Related Discrimination – A taxi driver refusing to take a blind customer because they have a guide dog"</li>
        <li>"Failure by an organisation to make reasonable adjustment to allow disabled people access to goods, facilities and services"</li>
        <li>"Victimisation"</li>
        <li>"Harassment"</li>
        <li>"Sexism"</li>
        <li>"Sexual Orientation"</li>
        <li>"Refusing someone because of their gender"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        It is a business and company’s responsibility to allow anyone and everyone access to their website, business and goods regardless 
        of who they are or what they are.
