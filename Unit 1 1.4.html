    <h1>Describing The Risks That Might Impact Digital Projects</h1>

    <p>
        There are many risks involved when creating a digital project. Computer viruses, trojans and malware are all forms of nasty computer programs with the sole creation 
        of stealing information, damaging computers operating systems or even both. They are most commonly found on shifty emails claiming that the recipient has won a lot
        of money that they are currently not aware of, or from downloading files from insecure websites that show the connection between them and the user is not encrypted. <br>
        Another risk comes from not saving or backing up the digital project regularly to prevent data loss. There is a chance that a computer that you've spent hours 
        working on for this project suddenly turns off and it always happens when you haven't saved your work for the last couple hours resulting in you having to re-do 
        everything you had just done for the second of even third time. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Backing up your data is just as crucial because in a serious case, the pc your working on gets completely destroyed and will need to be factory reset to remove
        everything and perform a fresh install of windows. This won't be as bad if everything you have on your computer was backed up to an external hard-drive or all 
        your important files, at the very least, were saved to the cloud. <br>
        The cloud is an online storage service by Apple, Google and many others that allows you to 
        perform a backup, up to a certain amount of memory, of your files. More memory should be available to be purchased directly from the supplier of the cloud storage 
        service you've chosen. <br>
        A risk with the cloud storage is internet access. To be able to use this service, you need access to the internet in the first place, the risk is, there is a rare chance that you're computer is automatically backing up your data to the cloud storage when suddenly your internet connection is cut for whatever reason. This will 
        suspend the back up until the connection has been re-established but pairing that with any of the risks listed above could result in the loss of all data with very few, if not any at all, way to recover your data.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another risk that could affect digital projects could be the collapse of communication between the team or the breakdown of the team. A product can be changed a lot 
        by the breakdown of communications between team members or if the team can no longer work together collectively. The collapse of communication between team members
        can result in the one person's ideas becoming the majority of the final product to the others dismay which may result in the final project being very little in 
        similarity when compared to the plan that the team put together at the beginning. <br>
        The same would happen if the team separated as they would be in charge of their 
        own projects and will have a lot more responsibility to keep on top of to ensure the project is done correctly. Working alone also would require more time to do 
        the same amount of work when compared to the team working together.
